<span class="pagetitle">Preface</span><br><br>
Kiriwrite originally came into existence in 2003 when I was designing a new layout for my personal website (Kirinji's Pad) and found that I had so many pages to edit, I had to find an easier way of editing the website layout as I needed to and apply those changes to all of the pages on the website very quickly.<br><br>
As I was designing my website using an advanced free ware text-editor (at it's time) which allowed me to create a template and create pages as I needed which was great, until I wanted to redesign the website. At that point I had around 50 pages which had to be changed and became somewhat time consuming.<br><br>
That was when I wrote the original Kiriwrite script which was coded pretty much to my own needs and wasn't really well organised and was coded in Perl (although not that brilliantly as strict and warnings weren't used since I was learning Perl at the time) and by the time I finished coding it, I was able to do what I needed to do with Kiriwrite.<br><br>
Around the end of 2005 (and after a two-year spell at St. Austell College which is now Cornwall College St. Austell) I decided to rewrite the Kiriwrite code because the original Kiriwrite did not do any input validation and so little of the code was commented which meant I forgot what everything did and I wanted to add some new features which would become useful in the future.<br><br>
The rewritten Kiriwrite version was pretty much done in October 2006, following a suggestion from a good friend I decided to replace the flat-file based system which I used since the original Kiriwrite with a file-based database system called SQLite. Once that was done pretty much around the end of January 2007, I then separated the database code, presentation code and language strings into separate modules and files which meant that a MySQL 5.x server-based database could be used instead of file-based SQLite. The presentation code used to render internal output from Kiriwrite was separated and placed in the HTML4S (HTML 4.01 Strict) presentation module. The language strings that was hard-coded were separated and placed in the English (British) language file.<br><br>
After some minor tweaks, the rewritten Kiriwrite code was pretty much ready and once the documentation was written Kiriwrite was ready for release. What I would like to see in the future for Kiriwrite is to make it work with mod_perl and add some extra customisable features as some settings are currently hard-coded when they could very well not be hard-coded.<br><br>
I leave you with some advice, if you are going to design a website which uses a white background don't assume everyone will use a white background by default if no colour is specified and actually declare it as white background in the Cascading Style Sheet markup. You'd be amazed at how many commercial websites and some personal websites (that expect you to have) assume you have a white background when really you have a teal coloured background.<hr>
<span class="pagetitle">Introduction</span><br><br>
Kiriwrite is a web-based (browser-based) interface for creating pages for websites, intended for those who know how to create pages by hand and want to accelerate the process of (re)designing a static-only website.<br><br>
The documentation is split into three parts, the user documentation (which is this part), the developer documentation (for writing new modules or language files) and the tutorial documentation (the basics and how to use Kiriwrite).<br><br>
Although Kiriwrite isn't limited for creating pages for websites (as in you can create other types of text-based formats), Kiriwrite is primarily intended for creating pages for websites.<br><br><hr>
<span class="pagetitle">Chapter 1: Installation</span><br><br>
Before Kiriwrite can be used, Kiriwrite needs to be installed properly and this involves obtaining the code from a source package or from a Subversion<sup>1</sup> repository, copying the needed files into the correct place, setting the correct permissions on the files and running the installation script.<br><br>

<div class="warningbox">
    <div class="message warning">
        <span class="warningtext">
            <b>Warning</b><br>
            Please be aware (for this version), that Kiriwrite <b>is intended to be used on a private web server and not on a public web server unless it is properly secured down</b> because by default anyone can run Kiriwrite and manipulate the data already there. Suggested methods of securing down your Kiriwrite installation are available in Chapter 4: Usage Tips.
        </span>
    </div>
</div>

<br>

This chapter is split into two parts with the first part explaining on how to obtain Kiriwrite and the second part explaining on how to install Kiriwrite.<br><br>

<div class="footnote"></div>
<sup>1</sup> Subversion is a version control system which tracks changes to data stored in the repositories and allows easy updating of source code after the source code is checked out.<hr>
<span class="pagetitle">1.1 Obtaining Kiriwrite</span><br><br>
Kiriwrite can be obtained either through the Subversion repository or extracted from a source archive that is available on Kiriwrite homepage.<br><br>
<span class="heading">1.1.1: Archive Extraction</span><br><br>
The contents of the Kiriwrite archive can be extracted using gzip if it's a Gzip archive, bzip2 if it's a Bzip2'ed archive, 7za if it's a 7-Zip archive and unzip if it's a ZIP archive.<br><br>
Bear in mind the following is done from a command console. GUI interfaces can also do the same as preformed here and mainly involves opening the archive and clicking on the Extract/Extract All button or simply dragging the folder containing from out of the archive (usually making a copy of the contents in the archive).<br><br>

<div class="messagebox">
    <div class="message note">
        <b>Note</b><br>
        The naming convention of the Kiriwrite archives go as the following:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
            kiriwrite-x.y.z(-e).arc
        </div>
        <br>
        Where x is the major version, y is the minor version and z is the revision with (-e) meaning a very tiny modification that had to be done that did not merit an increment to the revision number.
    </div>
</div>

<br>

When downloading an archive, the archive can be checked (by downloading the file with the same name but with .sha256 or .md5 added to the end of it) using shasum<sup>1</sup> or md5sum by doing the following to ensure it is downloaded correctly:<br><br>

<div class="code">
    shasum -a 256 kiriwrite-x.y.z(-e).arc<br>
    md5sum kiriwrite-x.y.z(-e).arc
</div>

<br>

shasum or md5sum should then generate the SHA-256 or MD5 checksum that should match the one that appears in the file with .sha256 or .md5 appended to it. If it does not match (and the file containing the sha256 or md5sum hash is the correct version) then the archive should be downloaded again and repeat the same process.<br><br>
To extract the gzip archive, the following command should be preformed when switched to the correct directory to extract from.<br><br>

<div class="code">
    gzip -d -c <i>(path)</i>/kiriwrite-0.1.0.tar.gz | tar -xv
</div>

<br>

A list of files that have been extracted will then appear with the contents of the archive appearing in the directory that the archive was extracted to.<br><br>
To extract the bzip2 archive, the following command should be preformed when switched to the correct directory to extract from.<br><br>

<div class="code">
    bzip2 -d -c <i>(path)</i>/kiriwrite-0.1.0.tar.bz2 | tar -xv
</div>

<br>

A list of files that have been extracted will then appear with the contents of the archive appearing in the directory that the archive was extracted to.<br><br>
To extract the ZIP archive, the following command should be preformed when switched to the correct directory to extract from.<br><br>

<div class="code">
    unzip <i>(path)</i>/kiriwrite-0.1.0.zip
</div>

<br>

A list of files that have been extracted will then appear with the contents of the archive appearing in the directory that the archive was extracted to.<br><br>
To extract the 7Zip archive, the following command should be preformed when switched to the correct directory to extract from.<br><br>

<div class="code">
    7za e <i>(path)</i>/kiriwrite-0.1.0.7z
</div>

<br>

A list of files that have been extracted will then appear with the contents of the archive appearing in the directory that the archive was extracted to.<br><br>

<span class="heading">1.1.2: Subversion Access</span><br><br>
Kiriwrite can also be obtained through checking out the code from the Subversion repository.<br><br>

<div class="messagebox">
    <div class="message note">
        <b>Note</b><br>
        Bear in mind that the code that is in the Kiriwrite Subversion repository is normally unstable and could very well cause unexpected problems (such as warnings that appear in the web server error log that can be easily fixed and alterations to the database structure which requires an upgrade script which hasn't been written yet for that particular version yet).
    </div>
</div>

<br>

Kiriwrite can be obtained from the Subversion repository by doing the following in a command console after selecting the correct directory to put it in:<br><br>

<div class="code">
    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/kiriwrite/trunk
</div>

<br>

A list of files then appear as they are received from the Subversion repository and placed in the directory the command console is currently in. To update the code stored locally with code that is in the Kiriwrite Subversion repository this command should be done after changing to the directory where the local copy of the Kiriwrite Subversion code is:<br><br>

<div class="code">
    svn update
</div>

<br>

A list of files will then appear showing which files has been updated.

<div class="footnote"></div>
<sup>1</sup> The version of shasum talked about here is the shasum script that is used by the Digest::SHA::PurePerl Perl module which can produce checksums in SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 which can be installed via CPAN.<hr>
<span class="pagetitle">1.2.1 Copying files</span><br><br>
Before Kiriwrite can be used, the files need to be copied to the correct place. After extracting the archive, the structure of the extracted archive should be like this:<br><br>
<b>Documentation</b> – Documentation that is available in several languages.<br>
<b>cgi-files</b> – The main Kiriwrite script, associated modules, installer script and language files.<br>
&nbsp;<b>Modules</b> – Modules for Kiriwrite are stored here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Database</b> – Database modules are stored here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Presentation</b> – Presentation modules are stored here.<br>
&nbsp;<b>db</b> – Default database directory (for file based Database modules).<br>
&nbsp;<b>lang</b> – The directory for language files in Kiriwrite.<br>
&nbsp;<b>lib</b> - Library files that are used by Kiriwrite.<br>
&nbsp;<b>output</b> – The output directory when pages are compiled.<br>
<b>misc</b> – Miscellaneous files (mainly for developers).<br>
<b>non-cgi-files</b> – Non CGI files that need to be placed outside of the cgi-bin folder.<br><br>
The files in the cgi-files folder should be copied to the cgi-bin<sup>1</sup> folder<sup>2</sup> and the files in the non-cgi-files folder should be copied to a folder which can be accessed from the web server.<br><br>
<span class="heading">1.2.2 Setting Permissions</span><br><br>
The following permissions should be set for the files that have been copied to the cgi-files directory (the following file list should apply to those running *nix/BSD systems):<br><br>

R = Read, W = Write, X = Execute/Allow directory listing<br><br>
For the non-cgi files folder, read only permissions should be set on all files (and read and allow directory listings for directories) as no writing should be needed.<br><br>
Once this is done, the installer script can be run by browsing to URI location of where the files in the cgi-files directory were in place and adding install.cgi to the end of it.<br><br>
<div class="footnote"></div>
<sup>1</sup>The cgi-bin folder is used for storing scripts that use the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). CGI scripts are typically associated with Perl scripts but can also be C++, C, Python, shell script and many others.<br>
<sup>2</sup>Some servers are configured so that CGI scripts can run from any directory so in this case Kiriwrite doesn't have to be placed in the cgi-bin directory.<hr>
<span class="pagetitle">1.3 Kiriwrite Installer Script</span><br><br>
After pointing your browser to the installer script, a page appears which guides you through configuring the settings for Kiriwrite.<br><br>
At the top of the page a drop down box is available to change the language of the installer script to another language which is more easier to understand, simply select the language from the drop down box and click on the Switch button, the script will then switch to the selected language.<br><br>
The installer script will preform three tests, the first being to check if all the needed modules are there, the second test is to check if the modules needed for the database modules are there and finally a test to check if the directories have their correct permissions set.<br><br>
Before the settings can be configured, checks are made to make sure that all of the needed modules are installed properly. If any of the needed modules are missing an error message will appear saying that one or more of the required Perl modules is missing and will need to be installed which can be done from the CPAN interface.<br><br>
The installer script then checks to see if at least of the Perl modules for the database modules are installed. If none of the Perl modules needed for the database modules are found then an error message will appear saying that none of the Perl modules needed for the database modules are installed and will need to be installed which can be done from the CPAN interface.<br><br>
Finally, the installer script then checks to see if the directories have the minimum correct permissions set. If one or more of the directories has an error, then a message appears saying to make sure that the correct permissions are set.<br><br>

<div class="messagebox">
    <div class="message hint">
        <b>Hint</b><br>
        More information on solving problems that occur while installing Kiriwrite can be found in Chapter 5: Troubleshooting.
    </div>
</div>

<br>

When the installer finds that everything is fine in regards to Perl modules and file permissions, a form appears allowing to configure the Kiriwrite installation to specific needs. Some default values are given which will work with the file-based database modules.<br><br>
The configuration settings in detail:<br><br>

There is an option that is enabled by default to attempt to delete the installation script after the configuration file has been written since the installation script would no longer be needed after that. Unchecking the box for this option disables this.<br><br>
Click on the Save Settings button to write the configuration file or the Reset Settings button to restore the settings to their default values.<br><br>
After clicking on the Save Settings button, some checks are made to make sure that data passed is correct, the configuration file is written (and the installer script deleted if requested) and a message appears saying that Kiriwrite can now be used by clicking on the link at the bottom of the page.

<span class="pagetitle">Chapter 2: Operation</span><br><br>
Now that Kiriwrite is installed and working, this chapter is about operating Kiriwrite. This chapter is split into five parts:<br>

<ul>
<li>Databases, how to add a database, edit a database and delete a database.</li>
<li>Pages, Selecting a database, creating, editing and deleting pages, deleting, moving, copying and editing multiple pages.</li>
<li>Filters, adding a filter, editing a filter and deleting a filter.</li>
<li>Templates, adding a template, editing a template and deleting a template.</li>
<li>Compiling, compiling one, selected or all databases and cleaning the output directory.</li>
</ul><hr>
<span class="pagetitle">2.1 Databases</span><br><br>
Databases are used for storing the pages that are created in Kiriwrite. Before pages can be stored in a database, a database has to be created.<br><br>
The default view when you run the Kiriwrite script is to show the list of databases. If there are no databases available, then a message appears saying that there are no databases than can be used.<br><br>
<span class="heading">2.1.1 Add a database</span><br><br>
To add a database, from the View Databases sub-menu click on the 'Add Database' link, a form then appears allowing to enter the information about the new database.<br><br>

<span class="pagetitle">Chapter 4: Usage Tips</span><br><br>
This chapter mainly contains usage tips in securing your Kiriwrite installation and small features which may be useful for some users.<br><br>

<div class="specific apache132x">
   In this chapter, directory specific settings used in Apache is .htaccess. Typically, if the web server software is configured to check a file other than .htaccess then a different filename would be used (and would be blocked from being accessed from the web server).
</div>
<hr>
<span class="pagetitle">4.1 Securing your Kiriwrite installation</span><br><br>

This section is about securing your Kiriwrite installation.<br><br>

<span class="heading">4.1.1 HTTP Authentication</span><br><br>

HTTP Authentication allows users who only know the correct username and password to access pages that are not available to the public. HTTP Authentication is done by the following if you're using Apache 1.3.x/2.x from a command console:<br><br>

<div class="code">
    htpasswd -c .htpasswd username
</div>

<br>

The -c switch specifies that a password file should be created called .htpasswd (although can be called something else), while username is the username of the login (which can be something else other than username), after pressing enter a password prompt then appears asking for a password to be entered the same twice.<br><br>

After the .htpasswd file is created, the file should be copied to a location that cannot be accessed from a URI resource (such as outside the htdocs/web documents directory) and then create a .htaccess file (if it doesn't exist) pointing to the password file with the following directives as an example.<br><br>

<div class="code">
    AuthUserFile /home/www/website/private/.htpasswd<br>
    AuthType Digest<br>
    AuthName “Private Area”
</div>

<br>

The AuthUserFile directive should point to the htpasswd file that was created earlier on. The AuthType directive specifies the authentication type to use and AuthName specifies the name of the area to appear when entering the username and password.<br><br>

<span class="heading">4.1.2 IP Address Filtering</span><br><br>

IP Address filtering allows certain IP addresses or hosts to be blocked from access and allowing everyone else access or blocking everyone from access and allowing certain IP addresses or hosts in. Typically when using Kiriwrite, the best method would be the white list method where everyone is blocked from access and only certain IP addresses or hosts can be allowed access.<br><br>

To setup a white list, open the .htaccess file and insert the following (if it already exists) if you're using Apache 1.3/2.x:<br><br>

<div class="code">
    Order Deny, Allow<br>
    Deny from all<br>
    Allow from 127.0.0.1
</div>

<br>

This example denies everyone and then only allows 127.0.0.1 (which is the computer the web server is running from which tends to be the machine you're using on a personal installation). Multiple Allow commands can be entered which allows multiple hosts.<br><br>

More information on using Allow and Deny can be found in the Apache 1.3/2.x Documentation.<hr>
<span class="pagetitle">4.2 Renaming the main Kiriwrite script (kiriwrite.cgi)</span><br><br>

While the Kiriwrite script can be used as kiriwrite.cgi, the script has been designed so that it can work if it's renamed to something else such as docmake.cgi, private.cgi or even flyingrhinos.cgi. This can simply be done by renaming the script to whatever name is needed.<br><br>

<div class="warningbox">
    <div class="message warning">
        <span class="warningtext">
            <b>Warning</b><br>
            Bear in mind that no matter what the script filename is called, it will always look for configuration file as kiriwrite.xml, the modules in the Modules directory and the language files in the lang directory.
        </span>
    </div>
</div>
<hr>
<span class="pagetitle">4.3 Removing unneeded modules and language files</span><br><br>

As Kiriwrite uses a modular system for manipulating the databases, outputting the pages internally by Kiriwrite and language files for each language used, space can be recovered by removing unneeded modules from the Modules directory and language files from the lang directory.<br><br>

To make sure that the currently used database module, presentation module and language file are not deleted from their directories. Check which ones should be kept by clicking on the 'View Settings' menu link.<hr>
