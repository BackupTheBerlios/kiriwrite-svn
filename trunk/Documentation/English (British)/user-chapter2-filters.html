Filters allows text to be easily replaced by looking for certain words, tag or phrase and then replacing it with another set of words, tag or phrase.<br><br>

The list of filters can be viewed by clicking on the 'View Filters' link.

When compiling the pages, the order of the filters list is determined by the filter priority number with the lower numbers being processed first and the filters with the higher filter priority numbers being processed last.<br><br>
